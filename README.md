# Fantasy-Football-Machine

Right now this is the very beginning of a comprehensive project on fantasy football. My goals are as follows:

Start with per season data, then eventually weekly data. Weekly is more involved than per season
Gather data across multiple sources, as much as possible **>>>> currently at this step, gathering and mergind data**
Once data is together, make a beautfiful Power BI dashboard
Once Power BI dashboard is done, start building predictive models for season long scores, for purpose of next years fantasy draft
